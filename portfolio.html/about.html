              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>I am a Software Developer, I also like to think of myself as a programmer because I don't consider Software Development to be 'one size fits all'. I think of programming as a design pattern that breathes life into software, programming is a design pattern that be can be "stringed" to achieve personal desires and surpass achievements laid down by the ones before us. My interests lie in Avionics and Space Technology including user-interface design, data storage and reporting. I am a graduate of the University of Hull (LLB) and the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, London.</p>
